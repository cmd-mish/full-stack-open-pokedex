**Exercise 11.1**

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) is a process of developing software in short cycles that enable easier development, collaboration between developers and help avoid building up errors. The CI/CD is achieved by pushing updates to the main/production branch of a repository as often as several times per day, then an automated process builds the application and runs a set of tests that verify the integrity of the app.

In case of Java, Jenkins ecosystem is most used for implementation of CI/CD flow. Jenkins is a CI server primarily written in Java itself and provides a variety of plugins for task automation, for example, compile a Java source code, build a JAR from the classes based on time or an event (e.g., git pus). The ecosystem follows the execution of the predefined steps and notifies the developer about the result. 

Other than Jenkins, CI/CD for Java can also be implemented other tools such as TeamCity, Buddy, or Bamboo CI. The first one is developed by JetBrains and provides more customisation of a pipeline. Buddy suits the best for web developers and designers as it provides user-friendly interface and if web based. The latter one, Bamboo CI, offers such tools as automatic build, testing and deployment of multiple projects simultaneously. It also provides a better REST API and error reporting. 

Choosing between self-hosted and cloud solution for CI/CD depends entirely on the scale of the project. Where small and medium sized projects, such as a project with six developers, can be conveniently hosted with a cloud solution, the bigger the project grows the more financially viable it may become to run own CI server. Self-hosted solutions provide more options for customisation of pipeline and full ownership of the code, which benefits the security aspect.
